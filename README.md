## Alternative spelling for dictionary search

In order to search in the dictionaries the lemma instead of the inflected form:
```
I am searching{search} in many dictionaries{dictionary}.
```

## Headings

```
h1 This is a line.
```
`h` followed by the corresponding heading number makes the corresponding formatting

## Bold

```
//* multiline
text
to be bolded. *//

Alternately* each* sequence* of* 
non-space* chars* can* be* bolded.*
```

## Spaces

```
+ The plus sign turns into two spaces

+++ is usually the indentation for a verse.
